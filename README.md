Modeling Carnot Batteries (Thermal Energy Storage)

This is a project aiming to model thermal energy storages using heat punps for charging, organic rankine cycles for discharging and different kinds of storages.
For this, it is planned to use detailed fluid models (as implemented e.g. in CoolProp) and setting up systems which can either be steady state or (later) also unsteady.
Since this project just starts, do not expect too much.
It is aimed to have heat exchangers, machines and storages as compounds, which can be combined to different charging and dicharging configurations. For these, the energy balance, mass balance and further relations will be applied/solved.
Later on also thermo-economic calculations are planned.
